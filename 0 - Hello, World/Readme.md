# [1st problem in the 30-Days-of-Code-Hackerrank Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-hello-world/problem?isFullScreen=true)
## This repository contains the codes, I have been submitting in the 30 Days of Code program by Hackerrank.

## Objective
In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. You will need to use the same (or similar) syntax to read input and write output in challenges throughout HackerRank.

## Task
To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print Hello, World. on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

Note: The instructions are Java-based, but we support submissions in many popular languages. You can switch languages using the drop-down menu above your editor, and the  variable may be written differently depending on the best-practice conventions of your submission language.

The problem should follow the following format:

It will be updated after uploading all the required details in all the questions in the repo.
