# [8th problem in the 30-Days-of-Code-Hackerrank Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-arrays/problem?isFullScreen=true)
## This repository contains the codes, I have been submitting in the 30 Days of Code program by Hackerrank.

## Task
Given an array A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.
Note: ```()``` is considered to be an even index.

Example: 
A = [1,2,3,4]

Print ```4 3 2 1```. Each integer is separated by one space.

The problem should follow the following format:
