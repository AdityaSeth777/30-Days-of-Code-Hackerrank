# [30-Days-of-Code-Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code?filters%5Bsubdomains%5D%5B%5D=30-days-of-code)
## This repository contains the codes, I have been submitting in the 30 Days of Code program by Hackerrank.

I have mainly included the codes in the languages I know and am comfortable in.
The languages are mainly -> C, C++, Python, Ruby and Kotlin. I am currently solving this event. Source code of the programs solved so far have been uploaded. I will upload the remaining programs as and when I solve. Descriptions and logic of individual programs will be uploaded soon.


## 1. How to install and run C/C++ ?

### Installation ->
1. Create a ```C/C++``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/30-Days-of-Code-Hackerrank.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory, and navigate to your desired program -> ``` cd "folder_name" ```, and then to the code file.
4. Run ``` pip3 install gcc ```.
5. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts.  

### Usage ->
- To run any program (without <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -o name```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute; name = output executable file.
- Then type ``` ./name```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

- To run any program (with <math.h>), run ``` gcc filename.c -lm```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.
- Then type ``` ./a.out```, and then press Enter to execute successfully.

## 2. How to install and run python ?

### Installation ->
1. Create a ```python``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/30-Days-of-Code-Hackerrank.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory, and navigate to your desired program -> ``` cd "folder_name" ```, and then to the code file.
4. Go to the [Python website.](https://www.python.org/)
5. Download the software.
6. Install it according to the guide.
7. Open terminal and type ```python --version``` to see whether it is properly installed or not.
8. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts. 


### Usage ->
- To run any python program, run ``` python filename.py```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.
- If the above command doesn't work, then run ``` python3 filename.py```, where again filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.


## 3. How to install and run Kotlin (basic codes like these) ?

### Installation ->
1. Create a ```Kotlin``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/30-Days-of-Code-Hackerrank.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory, and navigate to your desired program -> ``` cd "folder_name" ```, and then to the code file.
4. An easier way to install Kotlin on UNIX-based systems, such as macOS, Linux, Cygwin, FreeBSD, and Solaris, is SDKMAN!. It also works in Bash and ZSH shells. To install the Kotlin compiler via SDKMAN!, run the following command in the terminal: ```sdk install kotlin```.
5. Alternatively, if you use Snap on Ubuntu, then ```sudo snap install --classic kotlin``` is a great method. 
6. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts. 


### Usage ->
- To run any Kotlin program, run ``` kotlinc filename.kt -include-runtime -d out.jar```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute ; out = output executable file.
- Then run, ```java -jar hello.jar```.

## 4. How to install and run Ruby ?

### Installation ->
1. Create a ```Ruby``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo ```git clone https://github.com/AdityaSeth777/30-Days-of-Code-Hackerrank.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory, and navigate to your desired program -> ``` cd "folder_name" ```, and then to the code file.
4. Go to the [installer website](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/), which will give us some ease in installing Ruby. Notice that the list of options has ‚Äúwith Devkit‚Äù and ‚Äúwithout Devkit‚Äù sections. The Devkit versions install the MSYS2 system, which will be required if you need to install RubyGems that require compilation. If you‚Äôre just going to play around with plain old Ruby, you might be able to get away with the non-Devkit version
5. And if you have Ubuntu (Linux), then run the following commands ->
    - ```sudo apt-get update```
    - ```sudo apt install ruby-full```
    - Once the installation is complete, verify it by running this : ```ruby --version```.

### Usage ->
- To run any Ruby program, run ``` ruby your_program.rb```.
- Else if this throws any problem, then :
    - start your program with ```#!/usr/bin/env ruby```.
    - make your file executable by running ```chmod +x your_program.rb```.
    - Run ```./your_program.rb some_param```.
