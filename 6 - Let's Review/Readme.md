# [7th problem in the 30-Days-of-Code-Hackerrank Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-review-loop/problem?isFullScreen=true)
## This repository contains the codes, I have been submitting in the 30 Days of Code program by Hackerrank.

## Task
Given a string, ```S```, of length ```N``` that is indexed from ```0``` to ```N - 1```, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

Note: ```()``` is considered to be an even index.

Example: 
s = adbecf

Print ```abc def```

The problem should follow the following format:
