# [9th problem in the 30-Days-of-Code-Hackerrank Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-dictionaries-and-maps/problem?isFullScreen=true)
## This repository contains the codes, I have been submitting in the 30 Days of Code program by Hackerrank.

## Task
Given ```n``` names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each ```name``` queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form ```name=phoneNumber```; if an entry for ```name``` is not found, print ```Not found``` instead.

Note: Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap data structure.


The problem should follow the following format:
